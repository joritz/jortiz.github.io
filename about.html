        <p>Pugs are a toy breed that originated in China over 2,000 years ago. They were originally bred as companion dogs for Chinese emperors and were treasured by royal families. Pugs eventually made their way to Europe, where they became a popular breed among European royalty as well. In particular, they were beloved by the Dutch royal family, and the breed spread across Europe, becoming well-known for their playful and affectionate nature.</p>
        
        <p>Pugs are small in size, typically weighing between 14 and 18 pounds, with a sturdy and muscular build. They have a distinct look with their wrinkled faces, large eyes, and short snouts. Their tails curl tightly over their backs, adding to their unique charm. While their appearance is unmistakable, it's their personality that makes them truly special. Pugs are known for being clownish and entertaining; they enjoy making people laugh and are generally very social and happy dogs.</p>
